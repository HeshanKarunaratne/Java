Abstract Classes 
-   Cannot be instantiated
-   Abstract methods have no method body and need to be inside abstract class or interface
-   Avoid code duplication and increases reusability
-   Purpose of an abstract class is to function as a base for subclass
-   Encapsulate some common functionality in one place and let sub classes implement differences

Common Example
-   Open file
-   Read file
-   Abstract method(phone and email)
-   Send via email/slack
